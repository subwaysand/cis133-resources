HTML Resource: https://www.codecademy.com/projects/language/html-css

	This resource is a very broad one, but the thing that I specifically like from this site is their projects. These are done where they give you a checklist style list of things your project has to have, and you end with something that makes sense. Also if you get stuck most of the projects and lessons too have walkthrough videos. One downfall is you get used to handholding and maybe don’t remember it as well as you should.

CSS Resource: https://stackoverflow.com/

	I think this resource is specifically good for CSS because it hinges on the extremely wide range of contributions from its users. This will help you see someone’s solution to a problem that you have, as well as maybe other problems you are likely to also run into. On the flip side, you can help others by contributing to answering questions that someone might have.
